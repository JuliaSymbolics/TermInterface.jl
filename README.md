# TermInterface.jl

This package contains definitions for common functions that are useful for symbolic expression manipulation.
Its purpose is to provide a shared interface between various symbolic programming Julia packages, for example 
[SymbolicUtils.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/SymbolicUtils.jl), [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl) and [Metatheory.jl](https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/Metatheory.jl).
